# Problem 1

## Create a Data Frame
* a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
```{r randome sample}
set.seed(1)
samp <- rnorm(10)
```

* a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
```{r logical vector}
log_vec <- samp > 0
```

* a character vector of length 10
```{r character vector}
char_vec <- c("This", "is", "a", "data", "science", "class", "please", "bring", 
            "your", "computer")
```

* a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”
```{r factor vector}
factor_vec <- factor(c(1,1,2,3,3,2,3,1,3,2))
```


```{r}
df <- data.frame(samp, log_vec, char_vec, factor_vec)
df
```

## Take mean of each variable
```{r}

```

# Problem 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
