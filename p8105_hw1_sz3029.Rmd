# Problem 1

* a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
```{r}
set.seed(1)
samp_1 <- rnorm(10)
samp_1
```

* a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
```{r}
samp_2 <- samp_1 > 0
samp_2
```

* a character vector of length 10
```{r}
samp_3 <- c("This", "is", "a", "data", "science", "class", "please", "bring", 
            "your", "computer")
samp_3
is.character(samp_3)
length(samp_3)
```

* a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”
```{r}
samp_2 <- samp_1 > 0
```

# Problem 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
