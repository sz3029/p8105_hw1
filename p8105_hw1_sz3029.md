# Problem 1

## Create a Data Frame

-   a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution

``` r
set.seed(1)
samp <- rnorm(10)
```

-   a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0

``` r
log_vec <- samp > 0
```

-   a character vector of length 10

``` r
char_vec <- c("This", "is", "a", "data", "science", "class", "please", "bring", 
            "your", "computer")
```

-   a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
factor_vec <- factor(
  c('c_1','c_1','c_2','c_3','c_3','c_2','c_3','c_1','c_3','c_2'),
  levels = c('c_1','c_2','c_3')
  )
```

``` r
df <- data.frame(samp, log_vec, char_vec, factor_vec)
df
```

    ##          samp log_vec char_vec factor_vec
    ## 1  -0.6264538   FALSE     This        c_1
    ## 2   0.1836433    TRUE       is        c_1
    ## 3  -0.8356286   FALSE        a        c_2
    ## 4   1.5952808    TRUE     data        c_3
    ## 5   0.3295078    TRUE  science        c_3
    ## 6  -0.8204684   FALSE    class        c_2
    ## 7   0.4874291    TRUE   please        c_3
    ## 8   0.7383247    TRUE    bring        c_1
    ## 9   0.5757814    TRUE     your        c_3
    ## 10 -0.3053884   FALSE computer        c_2

## Take mean of each variable

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
# Mean of random sample
mean(dplyr::pull(df, 1))
## [1] 0.1322028
# Mean of logical vector
mean(dplyr::pull(df, 2))
## [1] 0.6
# Mean of char vector
mean(dplyr::pull(df, 3))
## Warning in mean.default(dplyr::pull(df, 3)): argument is not numeric or logical:
## returning NA
## [1] NA
# Mean of factor vector
mean(dplyr::pull(df, 4))
## Warning in mean.default(dplyr::pull(df, 4)): argument is not numeric or logical:
## returning NA
## [1] NA
```

The calculation for the mean of the first (random sample of 10 from a
standard normal distribution) and second variable (logical vector)
works. For character vector and factor vector, it does not work.

## Convert Variables

``` r
as.numeric(samp)
as.numeric(log_vec)
as.numeric(char_vec)
as.numeric(factor_vec)
```

There is a warning message showing for the character vector, saying NAs
introduced by coercion.

The `as.numeric()` function converts whatever data type to double,
therefore:

-   The random sample contains only the numeric values, so it does not
    change

-   Logical vector contains flags of `TRUE` and `FALSE`, therefore it
    converts to vector of 1’s and 0’s

-   Character vector contains string of characters, which do not have
    numeric meaning, therefore such coercion makes R assign null values
    to them, i.e. `as.numeric()` does not work

-   For factor vector, `as.numeric()` return the underlying numeric
    representation, which is often meaningless as it may not correspond
    to the factor levels.

This explains the NA’s I got when I tried to take the mean of character
vector and factor vector, since `mean()` only takes numeric values.

# Problem 2

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## Description

The penguins dataset contains 8 different categories, species, island,
bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g,
sex, year. There are 344 rows and 8 columns. The data are collected from
year 2007, 2008, 2009. There are 3 species of penguins in total, from 3
different islands. The mean flipper length of the penguins is
200.9152047 mm, with a standard deviation of 14.0617137 mm; the mean
bill length of the penguins is 43.9219298 mm, with a standard deviation
of 5.4595837 mm; the mean bill depth of the penguins is 17.1511696 mm,
with a standard deviation of 1.9747932 mm; and the mean body mass is
4201.754386 g, with a standard deviation of 801.9545357 g.

## Plots

The next chunk plots the scatter plot of flipper length v.s. bill
length, colored according to species.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + xlab("Bill Length (mm)") + ylab("Flipper Length (mm)") +
  ggtitle("Scatter Plot of Flipper Length v.s. Bill Length")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

Finally, save the scatter plot:

``` r
ggsave("hw1_p2_scatter_plot.jpg")
```
